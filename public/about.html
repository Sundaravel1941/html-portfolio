<h1>About Me and My City</h1>
<p><h2> I am Sundaravel Shanmugam</h2> </p>. My native town is Thoothukudi, which was once famous for pearl fishing, silk weaving and handicrafts. </p>
<p>Today it is a sea-port city. Salt and dry fish are the impotant exports. The harbour is very busy.Some passenger ships<br>
are also seen in the harbour.<br>

<p>I am the eldest member of the family. My parents gave me a good education.<br>   
I had my school education  and higher studies in Thoothukudi itself.<br >
I got my B.Sc and B.T degrees from V.O.C college in Thoothukudi.</p>
<p>While working in a Higher Secondary school I developed a passion for reading books<br>
   In that way I learnt HTML and some computer languages</p>
<p>In our town there is a famous temple for Lord Muruga at Thiruchendur</p>
